# bus_berth_allocation

This repository contains the simulation model and the berth allocation algorithms used in a paper titled "Efficient Heuristic Methods for Berth Allocation at Multi-line, Multi-berth Curbside Bus Stops", which is published in "Transportation Research Part C" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X23002589).


# Installation

The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Please use the package manager pip to install:

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

Moreover, please install `mongodb` following: <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/>.

# Usage
The repository uses `mongodb` to store the numerical experiments results, and use the `sacred` package to manage the experiment results. The basic usage flow is as follows:

1. In `line_profile.py`, the bus line datasets used in the paper can be generated by calling the function `manual_add_to_db`. The datasets will then be added into `mongodb` database. By default, the line dataset will be stored in `line_profile` collection of `inputs` database.
2. For isolated-bus-stop cases, the `isolated_main_enumerate.py` will enumerate all the possible berth allocations and run the simulation to obtain the steady-state queueing delay metric. You can specify different queueing rules, line set no and so on. (Note that multiple threads can be used for parallel computing so as to speed up.) All the results will be saved in the `mongodb`, managed by `sacred`. By default, the simulation results will be stored in `runs` collection of `cx` database, where `x` is the berth number.
3. Given all the enumerated berth allocations simulated in step 2, you can run the `algo_main_for_enum.py` script, wherein you can specify the algorithm type (CNP method or Tan's method) and corresponding parameters. The algorithm will automatically retrieve the simulation results stored in the database. If no simulated berth allocation plan is found in the database, the simulation will be conducted immediately to evaluate the allocation plan. The algorithm results will be stored in `runs` collection of `cx_res` database, where `x` is the berth number.
4. For near- and far-side stops, you can run `signal_main_enumerate.py` script. In addition to the isolated scenario, you can also specify the cycle length, buffer size and green ratio for near- and far-side stops.

# Additional results
**The following  provides experimental results of the proposed CNP algorithm for more line sets. The bus arrival rates and mean dwell times for each line in both sets were randomly generated using the Dirichlet distribution, following the same method used to generate line sets 0 and 1 in the paper.**

### Results

The figures are similar to the ones shown in the paper. The description is thus omitted here. Readers can refer to the paper for more details.

### Results under a linear positive correlation between bus dwell times and bus arrival headways

The following figures present evaluation results when we modified the surrogate model such that a bus's dwell time is dynamically determined by its arrival headway, multiplied by a line-specific constant, which is the product of passenger arrival rate and unit boarding time per passenger. The line set 2 is used here. The line-specific constant is essentially the bus line's traffic intensity (the product of bus flow and mean dwell time). We can see that the very similar results like Figs. 4(a)-(i) in the paper are obtained, indicating the effectiveness of our heuristic methods. (Similar results are obtained for near- and far-side stops and thus omitted here.)
